For my day job, I am an assistant professor of Biomechanical Engineering at
Delft University of Technology. Most of the open source software I contribute
to is to support the research we do at the `Bicycle Lab
<http://bicycle.tudelft.nl>`_ and concerns the simulation and analysis of the
human-bicycle system's motion. I also write software to support my teaching and
learning activities. I also tinker with programming as a hobby and try to
exclusively use open source software in my computing tasks.

Educational Repositories
========================

- `Learn Multibody Dynamics
  <https://github.com/moorepants/learn-multibody-dynamics>`_: My online book
  geared towards learning computational multibody dynamics.
- `Resonance <https://github.com/moorepants/resonance>`_: A software package and
  collection of teaching Jupyter notebooks for learning undergraduate
  mechanical vibrations.
- `Teaching and Learning with Jupyter
  <https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/>`_: A book we co-wrote to
  give a starting point and best practices for using Jupyter (notebooks) in
  pedagogy.
