For my day job, I am an assistant professor of Biomechanical Engineering at
Delft University of Technology. Most of the open-source software I contribute
to is for supporting the research we do at the `Bicycle Laboratorium`_ and
concerns the simulation and analysis of the human-bicycle system's motion. I
also write software to support my teaching and learning activities as well as
tinker with programming as a hobby. I strive to use and contribute to
open-source software in the majority of computing I do. I have been a Linux
user since 2008 and maintain repositories of my dotfiles_ and `useful
scripts`_. I write most of my software in type hint-free Python, which is a
beautiful language to read and write, but I also write R, Bash, Octave/Matlab,
C, and HTML/CSS/JS.

I wrote my Ph.D. dissertation_ in the open with the goal of full computational
reproducibility, from raw data to figures and tables in the document, and to
have both a website_ and print version. Since then, I have tried to make all my
subsequent manuscripts reproducible in the same way. I have contributed code to
SymPy_ since 2011 and maintain the physics vector_, mechanics_, and
biomechanics_ packages therein for both research and teaching. I also help
maintain other SymPy physics packages and its code generation tools. To support
my and my lab's research, I have written and/or maintain a number of software
packages: BicycleParameters_, DynamicistToolKit_, yeadon_, HumanControl_,
pydy_, GaitAnalysisToolKit_, opty_, and cyipopt_.

I employ the ideas of computational thinking in much of my pedagogical design
and have written a `book`_ on computational multibody dynamics, a `software
package`_ for learning about mechanical vibrations, and contributed to a book
on `Teaching and Learning with Jupyter`_. I try to make all of my teaching
materials open access, which can be found on my various course websites:
eme134_, eme150a_, eme171_, eme185_, eng004_, eng122_, mae223_, mae297_,
me41035_, me41055_.
