For my day job, I am an assistant professor of Biomechanical Engineering at
Delft University of Technology. I manage my `C.V.`_, job application_
materials_, and my academic tenure_ and promotion_ materials in public git
repositories in the name of transparency.

Most of the open-source software I contribute to supports the research we do at
the `Bicycle Laboratorium`_ and concerns the simulation and analysis of the
human-bicycle system's motion. I also write software to support my teaching and
learning activities as well as tinker with programming as a hobby. I strive to
use and contribute to open-source software in the majority of computing I do. I
have been a Linux user since 2008 and maintain repositories of my dotfiles_ and
useful scripts_. I write most of my software with Vim in type hint-free Python,
which is a beautiful language to read and write, but I also write R, Bash,
Octave/Matlab, C, and HTML/CSS/JS. I primarily use Conda for package management
and help maintain about fifty Conda Forge feedstocks_.

I wrote my 2012 Ph.D. dissertation_ in the open on Github with the goal of full
computational reproducibility, from raw data to figures and tables in the
document, and to have both a website_ and print version. Since then, I have
tried to make all my subsequent manuscripts reproducible in the same way, e.g
6_, 9_, and 10_. I have contributed code to SymPy_ since 2011 and maintain the
physics vector_, mechanics_, and biomechanics_ packages therein for both
research and teaching. I also help maintain other SymPy physics packages and
its code generation tools. To support my and my lab's research, I have written
and/or maintain a number of software packages: BicycleParameters_,
DynamicistToolKit_, yeadon_, HumanControl_, PyDy_, GaitAnalysisToolKit_, opty_,
cyipopt_, and skijumpdesign_.

I employ the ideas of computational thinking in much of my pedagogical design
and have written a `book`_ on computational multibody dynamics, a `software
package`_ for learning about mechanical vibrations, and contributed to a book
on `Teaching and Learning with Jupyter`_. I try to make all of my teaching
materials open access, which can be found on my various course websites:
eme134_, eme150a_, eme171_, eme185_, eng004_, eng122_, mae223_, mae297_,
me41035_, me41055_. I manage TU Delft's `Conda distribution`_, providing a
consistent suite of open-source software to our computer labs.

I quite like using issue trackers to organize and discuss information, even if
not strictly about software development. For example, we use issue trackers at
the lab for research ideas_, funding_, and housekeeping_. We also have a little
program to select the next lab meeting speakers called whosnext_. I have even
used Github to host the bylaws_ of a non-profit I once helped create and run.
